## First steps: Setting the objectives

Objectives are set when the Marine Reserve is designed:

- What to monitor depends on objectives

>- Example:

>- A community may want two different types of reserves:

>- **Fully** protected vs. **Partially** protected

>- Indicators to evaluate each may be very different

>- *Our framework and analysis must be reserve-specific, not community-specific*

## Then

- Establish a baseline (biophysical, socioeconomic, governance)

>- Design **databases** and select **analysis** (failed [Eureka](http://eurekamarine.org/about-en/))

>- Select periodicity of surveys

## What COBI has been asking

Information that can be presented to:

>- Fishers and other users (asambly of fishers or comittees of MPAs)

>- Agencies and individuals responsible for conservation and fisheries management (SAGARPA ~ SEMARNAT)

>- Results that lead to:

>- Adaptation of management strategies

## What COBI is gathering

- Baseline

>- Annual monitoring (underwater ecological surveys)

>- **No systematic** monitoring of socioeconomics and governance

# Lack of coherence: **Here is where we come into play**

## What COBI wants (this project)

A way to evaluate No Take Zones (different) that allows them to adapt management:

>- How am I doing?

>- What should I do to be better?

# Extra slides

## Community envolvement

- COBI evaluates which set of indicators are subject to be compiled by community members

>- All communities have "survey divers" that are trained (accordingly) to monitor their *reserves and control* sites (selection criteria)

>- Some communities have members that have been trained in *Oceanographic monitoring*

>- Other data is gathered by NGO's, Government Agencies, Research Institutes or any *combination of the above*

## About Eureka

You can add information (abundance and size) for invertebrate and fish species monitored with transects quadrants or cylinders of any size.

You may also compare the information on abundance and size on any species inside and outside of the no-take zones over time (yearly), and obtain a graphic report of this comparison, and per site.
