Skype Call to Jorge Torre, Director of COBI

Subject: Define possible projects

Notes:
Jorge proposed three projects:
	- Using IUCN's "How is your MPA doing?" to asses COBI's MPA's
	- Role of women in coastal communities, fisheries and conservation
	- Comparing Isla Natividad and Bahía magdalena using IUCN and Eleanor's frameworks

Jorge said he would provide an internship
	- unpaid
	- preferably for JC (culture wise)
	- travel costs covered

For each project, the main client would be different
	- Alvin, Stuart, and Arturo
	- Jorge
	- Arturo

I must contact Alvin, Stuart, Arturo, and Maria José to get some insight

Proposal will be delivered January 7th (hopefuly)

At least one peer-review article will be generated
