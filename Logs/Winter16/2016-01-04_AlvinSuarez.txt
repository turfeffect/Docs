Skype Call to Alvin Suárez, Marine Reserves Science Director at COBI

Subject: Define objetives, available data, and products

Notes:
Alvin was briefed on the proposed projects by Jorge

A PhD student is currently working on a project using Ostrom's
approach to understand social aspects of each community. Alvin
will send the student's propposal to Juan Carlos. Works must NOT
overlap, and eforts must not be repeted.


Objectives: 

- The project's main objective is to identify wheather recover of
turf-reserves zones has taken place in COBI's reserves.

- When recovery has occured, the economic potential or beneffits
will be estimated, taking into account the investment made.

- The social part must be adressed in the sense of how the reserves
have made the community better, rather than identifying fishers
perceptions


Data Availability:

- Each region has extensive databases of biological monitorings.


Deliverables:

- Framework or model that allows COBI to decide wheater or not to engage
with a community

- Translated summary of the final report handed to Bren

- At least one peer review article:
	- Recovery of COBI's reserves
	- Potential economic benefits from recovery of COBI's reserves
